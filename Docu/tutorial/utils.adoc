BCD-UI provides a set of utils

==== DB wrapper

A set of DB wrapper eases working with differences between DB systems, driver bugs and several checks.
Each JDBC connection is wrapped as it serves a the factory for Statement and ResultSet and is the anchor point of the wrapping.
The following fixes and checks are implemented:

* Checking whether all Statements and ResultSets are closed by the application before the connection is closed. If not close is triggered, in debug mode, an Exception is raised
* Keep track of execution time of a Statement
* Bugfix regarding fixed length char fields in Teradata
* Audit all executed statements
* Some syntactical differences between Oracle and Teradata
* Lazy connection opening. Connection open is deferred until the connection is actually used.
