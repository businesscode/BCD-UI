[[DocAppsetup]]
== Application Setup

Here we assume you have you environment with Java and optionally Eclipse or another IDE already setup, otherwise see <<DocBootstrap,here>>.

=== Application Setup

A BCD-UI application is a regular Java EE application, web container is enough.
Follow these steps to add BCD-UI capability.

==== Set up a standard web project in Eclipse

If you do not already have a Java EE application, create a new one (menu:File[New>Dynamic Web project]).
You will need to make your application server aware of the new project. (This step is not directly related to BCD-UI.)
For tomcat either add a context file to your tomcat's config folder, having docBase pointing to your project.
Or add the project to the Tomcat started with Eclipse via WTP methods, by going to the server in the _Servers_ view and choose menu:Right Click[Add and Remove...]. +
For your new application add the database connections to context.xml, they will be used by BCD-UI.

==== Steps to add BCD-UI to your application

Option 1 for adding jars: Use gradle or maven::
Instead of manually copying BCD-UI and 3rd-party jars it is also possible to use a build tool with dependencies.
This document describes the procedure for <<DocGradle,gradle>> you can also easily derive the settings for maven from this.

Option 2 for adding jars: Manually::
BCD-UI comes packed as jars, which need to be made available in WEB-INF/lib to the application.
Two jars are needed, one is bcdui.jar and bcdui_theme_bcd.jar. The latter is theme-dependent. +
These (about 28) 3rd party libraries link:https://github.com/businesscode/BCD-UI/blob/master/Docu/development/dependencies.gradle[BCD-UI/blob/master/Docu/development/dependencies.gradle, window="_blank"] are needed, copy them into your project's WEB-INF/lib folder.

Add Entries to web.xml::
To register BCD-UI servlets and filters, add the entries from link:https://github.com/businesscode/BCD-UI/blob/master/Server/configFiles/web.xml[BCD-UI/Server/configFiles/web.xml, window="_blank"] to your web.xml.

Create an empty WEB-INF/bcdui/bindings::
All configuration files for BCD-UI are located at WEB-INF/bcdui. Create an empty `WEB-INF/bcdui/bindings` folder, later you add <<DocBinding,Bindings>> here.

This is all that is required to use BCD-UI in your application.

==== Optional steps

Add logging configuration::
Copy log4j.properties from link:https://github.com/businesscode/BCD-UI/blob/master/Server/configFiles/log4j.properties[BCD-UI/Server/configFiles/log4j.properties, window="_blank"]
to your project's src folder, this sets logging to a reasonable level.

Add BCD-UI java sources:: 
Please note this is not possible if the BCD-UI library is fetched via grade dependencies. +
For debugging of server components it might be helpful to add the java sources of BCD-UI to the eclipse workspace.
The easiest way is to download or git-clone the BCD-UI project from github to an extra folder outside of your workspace.
Then configure the source location via menu:Right-Click-Project(Build Path>Configure Build Path), by selecting bcdui-core.jar
and assign the `Server/src/main/java` of the download location as source attachment.

=== BCD-UI folder layout

While in Eclipse you will only see some jars, the web.xml entries plus configuration files at _WEB-INF/bcdui_,
BCD-UI logically follows the follwing layout.

==== Application server's view

From the application server's point of view, several resources like js files and servlets are mapped to `/bcdui` as if they where physically located there.
The StaticResourceServlet maps static resources to `/bcdui` and Java EE standard mechanisms are mapping the tags and servlets.

==== Overwriting BCD-UI with own sources

Knowing this physical project structure allows you to overwrite sources of BCD-UI selectively.

Java resources:: Just add a java class with the same package and class name as found in BCD-UI to your local project.
The application server's class loader will take care to give your source precedence.

Static resources:: Static resources like js, images or xslt are overwritten with the help of StaticResourceServlet.
To do so add a folder `WebContent/bcduiOverwrite` to the root of your project.
Below this, just put the overwriting source with the same name and folder location as the overwritten file.
