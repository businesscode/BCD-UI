      BCD-UI provides a set of utils
    </Body>
    <SubChapter title="DB wrapper">
      <Body>
        A set of DB wrapper eases working with differences between DB systems, driver bugs and several checks.
        Each JDBC connection is wrapped as it serves a the factory for Statement and ResultSet and is the anchor point of the wrapping.
        The following fixes and checks are implemented:
        <ul>
          <li>Checking whether all Statements and ResultSets are closed by the application before the connection is closed. If not close is triggered, in debug mode, an Exception is raised</li>
          <li>Keep track of execution time of a Statement</li>
          <li>Bugfix regarding fixed length char fields in Teradata</li>
          <li>Audit all executed statements</li>
          <li>Some syntactical differences between Oracle and Teradata</li>
          <li>Lazy connection opening. Connection open is deferred until the connection is actually used.</li>
        </ul>
