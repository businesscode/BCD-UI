=== Release Notes

The following release notes allow following BCD-UI's ongoing development. +
Potentially breaking changes are listed under _Incompatibilities_.

___
==== Release 5_7_0 ...in progress

.Major new features:
* switched to Java 17, Gradle 8.5, Tomcat 10.1

.Server:
* added zip packaging and download feature via static resourceservlet, ensure *.zip mapping in web.xml
* updated several 3rd party jars
* updated default web.xml and enforce usage of https
* cookies created are flagged as "secure"
* CORS: to make your app CORSable use `de.businesscode.bcdui.web.filters.ShiroFilter` as a replacement of `org.apache.shiro.web.servlet.ShiroFilter` and add `de.businesscode.bcdui.web.filters.CorsFilter` as a first in the chain and cover resources which should be available to CORS, or set it to `/*` to enable for the whole site.
* added BindingItem description element, also added to WRS Header

.Client:
* Login Widget to be used in login-pages, i.e. via `<bcd-loginng>` custom tag
* new dataprovider options tblSelect, tblSelectRow, tblUpdate, tblInsert, tblDelete which offers wrs -> object -> wrs functions (currently limited to wrs)
* added bcdui.bcdAlerter (.info/.warn/.error) to show a slide in alert
* autogrow attribute for textarea widget
* Firefox v137.0.2 stopped supporting xslt document() function, extended our implementation to firefox
* SideBySideChooser uses i18n tokens for source and target caption translations
* grid/cube/scorecard/far/tree get contextMenuResolver option to handle context menu options

.Security:
* Remove SPNEGO authentication mechanism as it is outdated, use oAuth instead
* Deprecate bcdui4.Cors Filter for better CORS control using bcdui4.HttpHeaderSecurity

.Development:

.Bugfixes:
* inputNg: consider value of "step" attribute for type="numeric"
* WrsNextIdentifierServlet: fix counter creation with blockSize>1
* internal logging is now compatible with Log4j2 async logging (also with disruptor based method for high throughput logging)

.Incompatibilities:
* In SQLEngine::transform '-' postfix needs to be converted to '\_' to omit table alias like `INSERT INTO $t.painTableName ($t.colName_) VALUES (1)`
* Removal of Internet Explorer support
* javax to jakarta switch (for several packages e.g. javax.servlet)
* new 3rd party jars set
* cookies created are flagged as "secure", requiring https
* add BindingInfo servlet to web.xml
* OAuth2 configuration in shiro.ini:
** OAuthAuthenticatingFilter properties renamed: authScope to scope, redirectUrl to redirectUri, apiEndpoint to userInfoEndpoint
** `redirectUri` became optional, and this value is then derived from Servlet context at runtime instead, supporting virtual hosts
** `userInfoEndpoint` became optional, the user-id is then derived directly from the id-token send from the token endpoint. The call to user info endpoint is then skipped.
** oAuth now requires a popup for the login window, this looks more consistent and allows for cookie SameSite=strict setting
** OAuth Realms now need to create the session on successful login and cannot rely on JdbcRealm doing that anymore
* wrq filter operator like automatically escapes %, _ and \ now. Don't use local workarounds where you add \ yourself.
* `bcdui.config.userName` now holds the value from bcdui_sec_user.name not user_login anymore
* `bcdui.browserCompatibility.isXYZ` for various browser detections updated. Removed `isIE`, `isMsEdge`, `isIE8`. `isChromiumEdge` became `isEdge`
* Remove msxsl namespace from preset namespaces
* comment widget uses bcdUpdateBy/bcdUpdateStamp binding items as default "addBRefs". If using the default renderer and custom addBRefs, readd these bRefs
* grid columns which use an optionsModel can be emptied via DEL. If empty values should not be allowed, ensure that the column is nullable=0
* bcdOnLoad/bcdOnUnload html attributes can only contain one function name, not multiple ones, no parameters. Function context 'this' will be the html element.

at least cube template writing /vfs/reports/*, detail export column selects /vfs/exports/*, docUploads /vfs/documents/*. Writing vfs bindings could be achieved via /WEB-INF/*/virtual/*.
* when using subject filters in bcd_virtualFileSystem, you need bnd:BindingSet/sec:SubjectSettings/sec:SubjectFilters/@backendCanBypassSubjectFilter=true
* WRS request optional url attribute at `BindingSet` to pick servlet is moved to root WrsRequest element
* Grid configuration files: change of namespace for C elements wrq:C -> grid:C, removal of wrq:Columns in grid:SelectColumns and grid:OrderColumns, so such elements are directly followed by grid:C
* removed ZipLet decodeAndDecompressToXMLWithXInclude functionality. Update possible calls to decodeAndDecompressToXML.
* bcdui.util.clipboard.paste and pasteCSVasXML don't return the value directly. It's a promise now, so use '.then( value => {...} ) to use the value.

. bcd_log_page renamed to bcd_log_pageperformance
. When using cellAndGuiStatusFilter via filterFromCell.xslt, period filters don't have @dateFrom/To attributes anymore
. Reduced list of Oracle reserved words, may lead to unwanted table alias in SQL. Consider bcdNoTableAlias. or raise list needs to be extended again for common cases.
. removed activeX based exports and especially mergeExport from lib, application exports should use the new ones (or include the merge function in the application)
. cube hides empty cells now by default. If this is not required, use cube:Layout/@removeEmptyCells="false"

==== Release 4_6_0

Major new features:

. Overall
* Reworked and updated JSDoc for all public JS API, provided as searchable HTML docu
* Removed all global JS symbols except bcdui and guiStatus
* Clear separation of public and private JS API calls via JSDoc
* Generating jsApiStubs with public API for IDE support
* Introduced file groups allowing to load only parts of BCD-UI
* Introduced targetHtml attribute which supports dom/jquery elements, selectors and ids for renderers and widgets
* Introduced HTML custom elements for renderers and widgets

. Components: Scorecard, Cube, Grid, Charts, Export

* Cube can now be instantiated as a class via new.
* New parameter 'contextMenu' for Cube and Scorecard allows to provide a custom url. true means default context menu, false is default and means no context menu.
* Export: 'no export' message is now i18n and supports custom messages.
* Scorecard aspects: Introduced calc:ExtensionRef as a reference to a fix value in scc:Extensions.
* Added common dm:DetailData specification for scorecard and cube.
* Introducing config attribute as a replacement for metaData, metaDataModel

. Widgets
* Introducing targetHtml attribute which supports dom/jquery elements, selectors and ids
* Switched to js rendering for widgets: dimChooser,formulaEditor,inputField,multiSelect,periodChooser,sideBySideChooser,singleSelect,textArea
* PeriodChooser sets "firstSelectableDay" (when not given, use today) when clicking the input fields
* For BlindUpDown Area, removed bodyIdOrElement and extra div in html, just provide targetHtml with body content. A blindUpDown change fires guiStatus now.

. Core
* Added various functions to dataProviders (write, read, remove, query, queryNodes, fire, onChange, removeDataListener, serialize)
* Added widget functions i18nAlert, i18nConfirm
* Added onReady and onceReady functions to AbstractExecutable
* Introduced DataProvider.fire(), removed need for having before/after listener sides. Handling is now done 'after' modification only
* DataProviderHolder can now be instantiated without a source and the source can be provided later
* DataProviders are firing onChange() when getting in ready status
* DataProvider write(), remove() set uncommitted-writes flag. Executing leads to WaitingForUncomittedChanges status (not ready) in this case until fire() is called. Fire and SimpleModel data load resets flag and sets ready.
* fire() executes ModelUpdater if available. This leads to additional ready status listener calls
* AutoModel got orderByBRefs parameter for optional customized ordering
* Adjustments to support Edge including some temporary workarounds until some confirmed Edge issues are fixed
* Switch to Servlet 3.0 spec, updated jars

. Themes
* Added uploader styling
* Simplified sidebar effect, item and section html/css
* bcdReport uses nth Child for even/odd coloring

. Security / Bindings / WebRowSet

* Closed remaining security wholes found by HP Fortify

. Build / dev

* Switched build system to gradle
* Producing a development distribution now

* Producing a browsable API HTML documentation now
* Providing autosuggest support for IDEs via API stubs now
* Providing js source code maps now
* Documentation files do now support all browsers (XSLT applied are applied during build instead of during browsing)

* Eclipse injection of BCD-UI into a project does now copy all binaries onto their final places, allowing a simple "export war" to create a build.

. targetHtmlElementId/targetHTMLElementId, use targetHtml instead
. metaData, metaDataModel, use config instead
. fireBeforeDataModification, fireAfterDataModification, use fire instead after modification (old functions available via legacySymbols)

Incompatibilities:

. Components:

* Scorecard: Js class Scorecard was renamed to ScorecardModel. Scorecard is now the scorecard renderer pluy model.
* Scorecard: scc:Kpi/@aggr was removed, it served as a default for calc:ValueRef/@aggr, but was confusing, use calc:ValueRef/@aggr directly.
* Cube: Moved bcdui.component.cubeConfiguratorDND to bcdui.component.cube.configuratorDND (similar for .cubeConfigurator, .cubeRankingEditor, .cubeTemplateManager)
* Cube: Format of detail export information changed, for new format see cube.xsd. Also note that 'scope' is now provided via chainParameters
* Cube/Scorecard: isDefaultContextMenu was renamed to contextMenu and supports custom urls now in addition to boolean

* Moved global popupCalendar(...) function to bcdui.widget.periodChooser.popUpCalendar(...)
* DimensionChooser does not need optionsModelXPath (+ relative) anymore. "dimensionName" attribute was renamed to "dimension"
* DimensionChooser uses /bcdui/conf/dimensions.xml as fixed dimensions model with http://www.businesscode.de/schema/bcdui/dimmeas-1.0.0 as default namespace. Hierachy level between Dimensions and Level elements, Level attribute "unique" replaces "requires" Nodes

. Core

* Removed all global JS symbols including all $ functions, except bcdui and guiStatus
* Removed _addDataModificationListener, _removeDataModificationListener. Use onChange, removeDataListener instead
* Removed bcdui.easing package

Major bug fixes:

. fixed cube tag to support template manager without the need of a ranking editor
. dimchooser should not initially clean its targetmodel
. cube toggle hideTotals accidentally removes all rows (chrome only)

* Added support for MS-SQLServer


Major bug fixes:

. close unmanaged connection in `ZipLet`

Incompatibilities:

. Widgets

* SideBySideChooser is now leaving less fragments in the statusmodel when de-selecting an entry
* New messagebox style for system errors. $bcdui.debug.lastErrorUrl, $bcdui.debug.lastErrorMessage and $bcdui.debug.lastErrorUnpackedGz variables are available for detailed information
* widgets API: add validationFunction parameter to validation api, now possible to provide custom validation functions

. Core

* init.tag reduced to one and only one js include (/bcdui/bcdui.js) which triggers the bcduiLoader now.
* Remove obsolete namespaces in doc before compression is done, this reduces ziplet calls (especially for Chrome)
* '/bcdui/servletsSessionCached/WrsServlet/*' was added to well known paths for WrsServlet, please update your web.xml, refer to Caching document to find out more about the session scope caching.
* i18n: loading of i18n data is now parameterized with sessionHash, allowing to facade the call behind CacheFilter to enable session-scoped Expire cache
* i18n API: in UI debug mode the translation retains the KEY in case no mapping was found, so that developers can debug for keys which are not translated yet.
* bcdui.core.RequestDocumentDataProvider: now can take any parameterized URL
* bcdui.core.RequestDocumentDataProvider: new parameter attachSessionHash(Boolean) attaches sessionHash parameter to every URL
* bcdui.core.RequestDocumentDataProvider: sessionHash parameter is added to every URL having '/servletsSessionCached/' in its path
* debug-context on dataProviders: data providers, such as Models, Renders, Wrappers, etc. may be assigned a debug-context making it easy to debug the objects
at runtime, especially in case object-ids are auto-generated. Just provide the debug-context at construction time, i.e. bcdui.factory.createStaticModel({data:yourData,debug:{info:"some special model"}}),
later, the debug can be retrieved in browsers debugging tools during runtime. The debug-context is *only* retained in case bcdui.isDebug is true. BCD-UI may augment that
context with own debugging metrics, to avoid property-naming conflicts dont use prefix 'bcd' in your properties.
* bcdui.factory._hashValue(String): returns simple hash of a string; before this function returned MD5 has which was more precise but was too CPU excessive
hence got script-non-responding errors in IE8. This function is also used by dataListeners to determine DOM changes
* Changes on 3rdParty libs:

* added doT.js - a lightweight templating utitility, consult link:http://olado.github.io/doT/index.html[http://olado.github.io/doT/index.html, window="_blank"] for documentation.

. SideBySide chooser was not waiting for its options model in init
. bcdui.i18n.syncTranslateHTMLElement({elementOrId:"id"}): translates the given node, too (including its children)
. bcdui.i18n.syncTranslateHTMLElement({elementOrId:"id"}): defers translation in case the i18n catalog is not loaded yet, there is no need to sync on i18nModel anymore
. execute tag uses webpage:coalesceStringToJsArray instead of coalesceJsArray to coalesce and split up idRef argument correctly into jsArrays

Incompatibilities:

. bcdui/disableCache flag has no influence on binding sets and subjectSettings anymore.
For bindings refresh use /bcdui/servlets/CacheManager?action=refreshAll
. init.tag, i18nModelId and initTranslate attributes were removed
. web.xml change mapping of bcdui4.BCDUIConfig to /bcdui/bcdui.js and add /bcdui/bcdui.js to bcdui4.ClientCachingFilter's init param ExcludeUrls
. For new system errors messagebox you should add widget.css .bcdSysError and .bcdSysErrorBody (see bcd theme for example)
. WidgetNG API: parameter 'disableResetControl' changed its default value to 'true', so widget's supporting this flag will not display reset controls per default.
. i18n data : is loaded from URL /bcdui/servletsSessionCached/WrsServlet/* to support session-scoped caching. Please bind your WrsServlet also to that URL

. Order-by was broken in cases where there were no values for a leading col-dim member for the first rows
. i18n messages priority was broken. Correct is: 1. client: bcdui/config/messages.xml; 2. bcd_i18n bidningset; 3. default in bcuilib.jar.
. Exports using tiny url failed.

Incompatibilities:

* New attribute BindingSet/BindingItem/@aggr, defining the default aggregator. Order is: 1. Wrq 2. BindingSet/BindingItem 3. MAX(varchar/date) or SUM(all others)
* SQL Generator adds missing SubjectSettings related joins. As a side effect, BindingSetInvocationHandler was removed


Major bug fixes:

. Rounding differences Charts / Tooltip

Incompatibilities:

. renamed binding set tinyurl_control to bcd_tinyurl_control
. BindingSet / SubjectFilter: the bindings definition has changed (see bindings.xsd), SubjectFilter element is now a child element of SubjectSettings,
and was child of BindingSet before.
. BindingSet / WRS write-protection: if you have a subjectSettings.xml configuration in your project the Binding will be write-protected and
you'll have to set up Security for each Bindings in order to be able to update data, please consult the <<DocSecurity,Security>> paper for more information.
. Property _.xml_ (node.xml and document.xml) is no longer available. Use standard XMLSerializer instead. In *.js replace (most of):
 `([\w]+[\w\.0-9\[\]\(\)]*)\.xml(?![\w"'( *=)])`  with:  `new XMLSerializer().serializeToString(\1)` 
. RequestDocumentDataProvider is not longer auto-refreshing itself unless isAutoRefresh is set on init or via setIsAutoRefresh(). This is now automatically done by a model if it is itself autoRefresh.
. bcd_virtualfilesytem BindingSet was renamed (it has now a bcd_ prefix).
. commons-dbutils-1.5.jar is now also needed as a new jar in WEB-INF/lib.

___
==== Release 4_5_0

Major new features:

. Scorecard, Cube, Grid, Charts

* Several performance optimizations for small scorecards

. Core

* @bcdxml:wrsHeaderEnough="true" on xsl:stylesheet and on root-xsl:params allow for indicating that only the wrs:Header part of the input wrs:Wrs is used.
This allows for Webkit performance optimization. When generating xslt, these attributes are evaluated fully independent for the generating and generated stylesheet.
* Completely reworked logging to be less excessive with more focus on page creation order and performance impact.
* Performance improvement for mobile webkit-based devices.
* Optional tiny URL support. A too long guiStatusGZ (&gt;1900 chars) will be stored in the database (if binding set tinyurl_control is available) while a tiny URL )is used instead. Optional ServletParameter for auto-cleanup.
* wrs-request allows url attribute on BindingSet element to specify a custom wrsServlet path relatively to contextPath, can also be set within CubeConfiguration BindingSet element. Generally (auto) model url attribute got a higher priority.

. Widgets

* showModalBox got a new argument onclick to allow a js function call (executed after the Modalbox.hide(); when closing the box).
* Dimchooser emptyValue and clearOption strings are now only valid for the input fields below level. For level you need to use emptyValueLevel and clearOptionLevel.
* Dimchooser got an optional mandatory attribute now making the input fields mandatory or not (default = true).


Major bug fixes:

. Charts did not handle infinity values correctly, they are now treated same as NaN, fix for longer left-y-axis labels, point series width and formatting of Y1Axis.
. CVS export did send the wrong request (saying 'csv').
. For Webkit only: Handling param docs with no namespace: They did inherit the prefix-free namespace of the xslt they were embedded in.
. Dimchooser single level mode works now for options models with specified relativeValueXPath and fix for mixed-mode initialization of values

Incompatibilities:

. Scorecard numberformatting: The scorecard's output model output did too often repeat a numbers's format (unit. scale) at the data cell
where it would have been sufficient to have it at the wrc:Columns/wrs:C.
I you see wrong formats in a report's output, make sure the renderer also uses the correct param columnDefinition for formatNumber.
. Scorecard model is now doing less implicit sorting, always use @sort and @total if you rely on sorting.
. init.tag has now initTranslate defaulted to false, i.e. the loaded page is only translated if this param is set explicitly to true.
. Removed support for using DWCT and BCD-UI on one page.
. Removed _bcduiConfig.isI18n and implicit xslt-param isI18n. On lib-level they were hard-coded to be true anyway.
. Timing: Asynchronous actions do now run with less delay for performance reasons. Incorrect order of actions or missing sync can now break if they did relay on a higher (never guaranteed) delay.
. Dimchooser emptyValue and clearOption strings are now only valid for the input fields below level. For level you need to use emptyValueLevel and clearOptionLevel.

___
==== Release 4_3_3_a

Major bug fixes:

. status:ClientSettings/cube:ClientLayout was cube:Layout before and the latter was sometimes confused with the main cube:Layout
. in rare cases, it could happen, that a generated SQL would have by 1 different table alias for a column than for the table on the first access to a lookup join after app start.

Incompatibilities:

. A chain argument createCube and cube tag, does now refer to the renderer's chain, not to the cube's model, use an explicit model to provide a chain
. As always, check BCD-UI\src\js\bcdui\i18n\messages.xml for changes regarding well-known messages.
. The WrsDataWriter doesn't support SQLXML type anymore. See BindingItem/@escapeXML.

. IE&gt;7 are not longer run in EmulateIE7 mode.
. Charts are now using SVG for IE &gt;= 9.
. Improved order of listener calling, will have no effect if API was (so it is not a real incompatibility) used correctly by can lead to failures if execution order in projects did depend on racing conditions.
. Where clause params of type numeric do now need to be actually numeric.
. The Dojo Framework has been removed. A hosting project can still use a standalone Dojo distribution side-by-side with BCD-UI.
. For charts, classsname bcdEmptyChart and i18n key bcd_EmptyChart are now aligned with convention.

. DataProviderWithXPath from now on returns a single node instead of a nodelist. Firefox isn't able to deal with nodelists as input parameter for xstl processing.
. The urlProvider listens now permanently to changes on its input model. Previously it was only executed once. And in case of changes it fires data modification events.
. The simple model has an additional parameter isAutoRefresh, that turns on that a model reloads automatically in case of a changing request model.
. Introduced $bcduiObjectMap shortcut for objects known by BCD-UI. Allows easier listing of all objects and avoids naming conflicts as objects are not longer created as global variables (was an issue in IE)
This is for debugging only and not a replacement of $getObject("myId")
. Attribute maxRows of Wrs request was merged into rowStart, rowEnd attributes.
. bcdxml:include can be non-required now, by setting isRequired=false. Then in case the resource is not found no error is generated.
. A soap fault send by the server is not longer an exception anymore but caller can decide how to handle it.
. New namespace http://www.businesscode.de/schema/bcdui/renderer-1.0.0.

Major bug fixes:

. Renderers without dependencies did not register themselves
. b:modelWrapper is not longer requiring an explicit id given when used inside a b:renderer tag
. xsl-import in generated xslt is now handled correctly
. ClientSettings was not removed in all cases as expected and some widgets did use it wrongly

Incompatibilities:

. Major changes regarding css. All class names start with bcd now and css reset was introduced
. PDF export does support more css settings now. May lead to changed layout due to changes in an external library
. Do update web.xml to have WrsServlet map to /bcdui/servlets/WrsServlet/* and /bcdui/servlets/cached/WrsServlet/*, i.e. append /* to both
. Some widgets tags (for example w:button) will create in-line instead of block elements and change their generated id
. References are now in namespace wrs instead of binding
. Not longer creating a global variable for each object, introduced $bcduiObjectMap shortcut instead, always use $getObject("myId") in your code
. htmlBuilder.xslt was moved into the xslt library
. Instead of the i18n tag, use the init tag to control i18n
. From the column attributes for Wrs and Bindings, the jdbc.column- and jdbc. prefix was removed. For example jdbc.column-type-name became type-name and jdbc.signed became signed
. Data providers are not longer created as global variables, thus write $getObject("myModel").xx instead of myModel.xx
. Parameter rendererId was removed from all widgets Tag- and JS-API. The internal renderer has now always the id = bcdrenderer_&lt;widgetId&gt;

=== Release Notes BCD-UI

BCD-UI 4 brings the following major improvements:

==== Modules and Components

Several core Components and Modules where improved, some where full integrated, having been templates only in previous versions.

Optimized Cube report:: The cube report got significant performance and memory enhancements based on dynamically generated XSLT stylesheets.
Therefore it can handle considerably more data now.
In addition, the cube will allow playing (reordering) with dimensions and measures on the fly without sever requests if the initial request already covered all needed data.
This kind of client-side cube brings high flexibility improved user experience and in addition removes load from the servers.
New enhanced ScoreCard:: The new ScoreCard is now consequently built on top of the repository, eliminating the need for ScoreCard specific configuration
where the information, for example about dimensions and measures, can be derived from the repository.
New Tree Report:: The new tree report allows for easier displaying report data in an hierarchical manner including lazy loading for deep levels.
New enhanced logging system:: The new logging system does now allow to exchange logging messages between client and server.
Further more each logging message can be linked to the corresponding page request, thus allowing to identify the requests belonging
logically together. This eases debugging as well as meaningful performance monitoring.
Caching:: The caching strategies where harmonized and do now allow an easier and more consistent specification of what is to be cached at server and client.
 Cached data can now be stored on file system and in database.

==== New declarative features

Many features which required custom code in the previous library can now be accessed declarative

Internal XML exchange format for hierarchical data:: For data than can be best represented in hierarchical for two different internal formats are introduced.
One is for data where each level has a consistent typing, as is the case for most reporting data
and one is for heterogeneous data, basically free XML, which is used for configuration information.
XSLT library:: A library of reusable XSLT stylesheets working on Wrs forms the basis of all components in BCD-4 and can also be used for extensions
Repository extension:: The internal repository is extended to support dimensions and measures for the full application setup and not just report internally.
The new repository will span the dimension and measure level across all bindings, thus reducing the need to repeat information on data artifacts and allowing out-of-the-box drill-down and drill-though in much more cases.
Furthermore the new repository is aware of the difference between indicator and plain measures and of root causes as a central artifact.
Combined data access:: A set of central database accessing options is now fully aware of the new repository infrastructure and of measures being stored row-wise to introduce new measures without changing the database schema.
Introduction of themes:: A cleaner separation of styles and functional elements does ease the development in corporate design greatly.
Further more the new themes supports browser-dependent syntax and features of layout

==== Client infrastructure

Browser compatibility for IE&gt;6, FireFox and Chrome:: The library does now fully support all major browsers
I18n:: All components of the library now come with full i18n support. In previous versions, only major components had support build-in.
Better support for integrating 3rd party toolkits:: Rendering and model creation can happen in JavaScript so that external 3rd party toolkits can be more easily integrated.
Fully asynchronous behavior:: All objects on a page are now fully asynchronous and have a declarative dependency.
This allows faster pages and eases development as dependencies do not longer influence the order of declaration.
In addition each component still loading or waiting for a dependency still loading can be displayed as a loading progress bar.
XSLT-embedded choosers:: Choosers yet only available for jsp usage can now also be used XSLT-embedded and this be used in wizards.

==== Development support

Developing with BCD-UI becomes easier in several places due to improvement of the development environment.

Development bootstrapping improvements:: A bootstrap application does now ease starting the development with BCD-UI
Rights model:: The library will support a generic rights concept, which can be address a different places as row-level security or navigation.
Leaving less parts to be built within a project.
Enhanced documentation:: Documentation was rewritten to be more consistent and comprehensive.
It covers general features, as well as code samples and a description of the API.
More consistent API conventions:: Almost any interface was reviewed to allow consistent naming and more speaking conventions for easier use.
Using XML and JavaScript name spaces:: With the introduction of XML schema for all fragments and the new JS core library of BCD-UI, for both elements, namespaces for easier identification are introduced.
Debugging area:: The debugging greatly improves inspection of objects on a page and their behavior
Enhanced internal XML exchange format:: The Wrs format was reviewed and allows a much more comprehensive data exchange now.
A short for is available for manual creation and all elements including choosers are now relying on the Wrs format.
Improved JavaScript support:: All entities that can be created with JSP tags or XSLT have a corresponding JavaScript API call.
