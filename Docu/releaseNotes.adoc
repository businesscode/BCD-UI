== BCD-UI Release Notes

=== Release Notes

The following release notes allow to follow BCD-UI's updates and to judge whether migrating to a newer version is worth it.
Some changes are not backward compatible and may require code change in the project. They are listed here as well.

. DimensionChooser auto hides level selector if number of visible levels is 1, this now also applies i fonly one is left via visible=false
. Library logging is using application server's local time for timestamps (has used database timestamp before).
  Due to asynchronous nature of logging the logging event creation time is now captured rather than database record insertion time.
  Affected loggers: bcd_log_access, bcd_log_error, bcd_log_login, bcd_log_page, bcd_log_session, bcd_log_sql
. bcdui.core.DataProviderWithXPathNodes: .getData() returns a document now (instead of an element), hence if used as a parameter to XSL-T the

. Legacy themes may need an update for the cube dragndrop/ranking area. See dhl-classic theme for details.
. new cube DnD Area and Ranking Area requires IE8 or higher (so check your frame tag for IE7 meta elements)
. removed optional cleanClientSettings=false from applyAction function
. generated sources use generated ids with prefixed bcdSId_ or bcdCId_ (Server/Client-sided), generated targetHTMLElement ids are generated from the id plus _tE postfix
. Scorecard: measurePerAggr are now in scc: namespace, adjust your aggregators to this.

* Added support for MS-SQLServer


Major bug fixes:

. close unmanaged connection in ziplet

Incompatibilities:

==== Release 4_5_5

Major new features:

. Scorecard, Cube, Grid, Charts

* cmp:Grid has got more configuration parameters
* cmp:Grid supports LOV references which are defined at BindingSet level

. Core

* Beside XSLT, js-function and .dott transformers are now possible as well.
* Models can be Javascript now in addition to DOM.
* Webworker are now supported for .js files containing transformers.
* TransformationChain does now understand all forms of chain/url itself, caller does not need anymore to build a chain.
* New "is a number" client side calc:Ian.

==== Release 4_5_4

Major new features:

. Widgets

* SideBySideChooser is now leaving less fragments in the statusmodel when de-selecting an entry
* New messagebox style for system errors. $bcdui.debug.lastErrorUrl, $bcdui.debug.lastErrorMessage and $bcdui.debug.lastErrorUnpackedGz variables are available for detailed information
* widgets API: add validationFunction parameter to validation api, now possible to provide custom validation functions

. Core

* init.tag reduced to one and only one js include (/bcdui/bcdui.js) which triggers the bcduiLoader now.
* Remove obsolete namespaces in doc before compression is done, this reduces ziplet calls (especially for Chrome)
* '/bcdui/servletsSessionCached/WrsServlet/*' was added to well known paths for WrsServlet, please update your web.xml, refer to Caching document to find out more about the session scope caching.
* i18n: loading of i18n data is now parameterized with sessionHash, allowing to facade the call behind CacheFilter to enable session-scoped Expire cache
* i18n API: in UI debug mode the translation retains the KEY in case no mapping was found, so that developers can debug for keys which are not translated yet.
* bcdui.core.RequestDocumentDataProvider: now can take any parameterized URL
* bcdui.core.RequestDocumentDataProvider: new parameter attachSessionHash(Boolean) attaches sessionHash parameter to every URL
* bcdui.core.RequestDocumentDataProvider: sessionHash parameter is added to every URL having '/servletsSessionCached/' in its path
* debug-context on dataProviders: data providers, such as Models, Renders, Wrappers, etc. may be assigned a debug-context making it easy to debug the objects
at runtime, especially in case object-ids are auto-generated. Just provide the debug-context at construction time, i.e. bcdui.factory.createStaticModel({data:yourData,debug:{info:"some special model"}}),
later, the debug can be retrieved in browsers debugging tools during runtime. The debug-context is *only* retained in case bcdui.isDebug is true. BCD-UI may augment that
context with own debugging metrics, to avoid property-naming conflicts dont use prefix 'bcd' in your properties.
* bcdui.factory._hashValue(String): returns simple hash of a string; before this function returned MD5 has which was more precise but was too CPU excessive
hence got script-non-responding errors in IE8. This function is also used by dataListeners to determine DOM changes
* Changes on 3rdParty libs:

* added doT.js - a lightweight templating utitility, consult link:http://olado.github.io/doT/index.html[http://olado.github.io/doT/index.html, window="_blank"] for documentation.
* log4javascript updated to version 1.4.9; now supporting $log.info("foo",{obj:"obj"}) object serialization and hierarchical logging we now from Log4J

. SideBySide chooser was not waiting for its options model in init
. bcdui.i18n.syncTranslateHTMLElement({elementOrId:"id"}): translates the given node, too (including its children)
. bcdui.i18n.syncTranslateHTMLElement({elementOrId:"id"}): defers translation in case the i18n catalog is not loaded yet, there is no need to sync on i18nModel anymore
. execute tag uses webpage:coalesceStringToJsArray instead of coalesceJsArray to coalesce and split up idRef argument correctly into jsArrays

Incompatibilities:

. bcdui/disableCache flag has no influence on binding sets and subjectSettings anymore.
For bindings refresh use /bcdui/servlets/CacheManager?action=refreshAll
. init.tag, i18nModelId and initTranslate attributes were removed
. web.xml change mapping of bcdui4.BCDUIConfig to /bcdui/bcdui.js and add /bcdui/bcdui.js to bcdui4.ClientCachingFilter's init param ExcludeUrls
. For new system errors messagebox you should add widget.css .bcdSysError and .bcdSysErrorBody (see bcd theme for example)
. WidgetNG API: parameter 'disableResetControl' changed its default value to 'true', so widget's supporting this flag will not display reset controls per default.
. i18n data : is loaded from URL /bcdui/servletsSessionCached/WrsServlet/* to support session-scoped caching. Please bind your WrsServlet also to that URL

==== Release 4_5_3

. Order-by was broken in cases where there were no values for a leading col-dim member for the first rows
. i18n messages priority was broken. Correct is: 1. client: bcdui/config/messages.xml; 2. bcd_i18n bidningset; 3. default in bcuilib.jar.
. Exports using tiny url failed.

Incompatibilities:

. removed cube1 related code, namespaces, etc

. Scorecard, Cube, Grid, Charts, Maps

* Charts: Better Axis/Grid scaling for integer based axis (scale=0)
* Charts: Better calculation of bottom margin for x axis captions with reducing caption length if needed. YAxis captions' scale value is obsolete due to dynamic digit allocation.
* Huge performance gain for maps on IE&lt;=8
* Scorecard definition has new optional sccConfiguation/@validAt, which is compared to @validFrom, @validUpTo (both incl) at /*/scc:Layout/scc:KpiRefs/scc:KpiRef and /*/scc:Kpis/scc:Kpi
for time-dependent scorecard definitions. You can choose to set a year or something like 201407, values are compared as numbers.
* More complete and reliable XSDs for everything around cube and scorecard.

. Core

* IE6-9 and new IE10+IE11 compatibility
* Java6 and new Java7 compatibility
* jQuery, currently 1.9.1, is now part of BCD-UI delivery. Note, $ is still the prototypeJS shortcut, use $jq for jQuery-$.
* RequestDocumentDataProvider is now always in line with the request model (inherits invalid state) and waits for it to become ready. Allows for easy change request model - reload model cycles. A new isAutoRefresh will trigger auto-refresh and throw a dataModification event.
* New allowed @aggr value "none", relying on the BindingItem/Column to define an aggregator function in plain SQL.
* Database Configurations added allowing client parameters and dynamic server parameters, consider reading <<DocConfiguration,Configuration>>

Major bug fixes:

. Rounding differences Charts / Tooltip

Incompatibilities:

. renamed binding set tinyurl_control to bcd_tinyurl_control
. BindingSet / SubjectFilter: the bindings definition has changed (see bindings.xsd), SubjectFilter element is now a child element of SubjectSettings,
and was child of BindingSet before.
. BindingSet / WRS write-protection: if you have a subjectSettings.xml configuration in your project the Binding will be write-protected and
you'll have to set up Security for each Bindings in order to be able to update data, please consult the <<DocSecurity,Security>> paper for more information.
. Property _.xml_ (node.xml and document.xml) is not longer available. Use standard XMLSerializer instead. In *.js replace (most of):
 `([\w]+[\w\.0-9\[\]\(\)]*)\.xml(?![\w"'( *=)])`  with:  `new XMLSerializer().serializeToString(\1)` 
. RequestDocumentDataProvider is not longer autorefreshing itself unless isAutoRefresh is set on init or via setIsAutoRefresh(). This is now automatically done by a model if it is itself autoRefresh.
. bcd_virtualfilesytem BindingSet was renamed (it has now a bcd_ prefix).
. commons-dbutils-1.5.jar is now also needed as a new jar in WEB-INF/lib.

==== Release 4_5_0

Major new features:

. Scorecard, Cube, Grid, Charts

* Several performance optimizations for small scorecards

. Core

* @bcdxml:wrsHeaderEnough="true" on xsl:stylesheet and on root-xsl:params allow for indicating that only the wrs:Header part of the input wrs:Wrs is used.
This allows for Webkit performance optimization. When generating xslt, these attributes are evaluated fully independent for the generating and generated stylesheet.
* Completely reworked logging to be less excessive with more focus on page creation order and performance impact.
* Performance improvement for mobile webkit-based devices.
* Optional tiny URL support. A too long guiStatusGZ (&gt;1900 chars) will be stored in the database (if binding set tinyurl_control is available) while a tiny URL )is used instead. Optional ServletParameter for auto-cleanup.
* wrs-request allows url attribute on BindingSet element to specify a custom wrsServlet path relatively to contextPath, can also be set within CubeConfiguration BindingSet element. Generally (auto) model url attribute got a higher priority.

. Widgets

* showModalBox got a new argument onclick to allow a js function call (executed after the Modalbox.hide(); when closing the box).
* Dimchooser emptyValue and clearOption strings are now only valid for the input fields below level. For level you need to use emptyValueLevel and clearOptionLevel.
* Dimchooser got an optional mandatory attribute now making the input fields mandatory or not (default = true).


Major bug fixes:

. Charts did not handle infinity values correctly, they are now treated same as NaN, fix for longer left-y-axis labels, point series width and formatting of Y1Axis.
. CVS export did send the wrong request (saying 'csv').
. For Webkit only: Handling param docs with no namespace: They did inherit the prefix-free namespace of the xslt they were embedded in.
. Dimchooser single level mode works now for options models with specified relativeValueXPath and fix for mixed-mode initialization of values

Incompatibilities:

. Scorecard numberformatting: The scorecard's output model output did too often repeat a numbers's format (unit. scale) at the data cell
where it would have been sufficient to have it at the wrc:Columns/wrs:C.
I you see wrong formats in a report's output, make sure the renderer also uses the correct param columnDefinition for formatNumber.
. Scorecard model is now doing less implicit sorting, always use @sort and @total if you rely on sorting.
. init.tag has now initTranslate defaulted to false, i.e. the loaded page is only translated if this param is set explicitly to true.
. Removed support for using DWCT and BCD-UI on one page.
. Removed _bcduiConfig.isI18n and implicit xslt-param isI18n. On lib-level they were hard-coded to be true anyway.
. Timing: Asynchronous actions do now run with less delay for performance reasons. Incorrect order of actions or missing sync can now break if they did relay on a higher (never guaranteed) delay.
. Dimchooser emptyValue and clearOption strings are now only valid for the input fields below level. For level you need to use emptyValueLevel and clearOptionLevel.

==== Release 4_3_3_a

Major bug fixes:

. status:ClientSettings/cube:ClientLayout was cube:Layout before and the latter was sometimes confused with the main cube:Layout
. in rare cases, it could happen, that a generated SQL would have by 1 different table alias for a column than for the table on the first access to a lookup join after app start.

Incompatibilities:

. A chain argument createCube and cube tag, does now refer to the renderer's chain, not to the cube's model, use an explicit model to provide a chain
. As always, check BCD-UI\src\js\bcdui\i18n\messages.xml for changes regarding well-known messages.
. The WrsDataWriter doesn't support SQLXML type anymore. See BindingItem/@escapeXML.

. It is not longer necessary nor recommended to define &lt;style&gt;vml\: *... &lt;/style&gt; or vml namespace at the root html element.
. IE&gt;7 are not longer run in EmulateIE7 mode.
. Charts are now using SVG for IE &gt;= 9.
. Improved order of listener calling, will have no effect if API was (so it is not a real incompatibility) used correctly by can lead to failures if execution order in projects did depend on racing conditions.
. Where clause params of type numeric do now need to be actually numeric.
. The Dojo Framework has been removed. A hosting project can still use a standalone Dojo distribution side-by-side with BCD-UI.
. For charts, classsname bcdEmptyChart and i18n key bcd_EmptyChart are now aligned with convention.

. Wrs validation checks now for type-name integer as well
. Wrs validation is now i18n aware and allows better error message formatting
. Allowing "." now for relativeXPath in widgets
. In a chain, it is now possible for an xslt to generate empty output (no document element) for an xslt to indicate a NOP. The input of that step is then used for further processing, to need for xslt to copy input anymore
. Using RequestDocumentDataProvider for model now as well. Thus you can use $getObject("modelId").urlProvider.requestModel.dataDoc.xml now to check the request for a model
. New method promptData() for all data providers for easier debugging, allows copy-pasting content for further evaluation
. Chart xslts are now split into two as common to allow xslt embedded creation of charts
. New well-known parameter available implicitly for all transformations.
They can be declared and used (as &lt;xsl:param name="guiStatus"/&gt;) without being given as a param to the transformation by the user.

.  `bcdCurrDate`  is ms when current transformation was started, nice also for temp_ids
.  `bcdChainDate`  is ms when current chain transformation was started

. DataProviderWithXPath from now on returns a single node instead of a nodelist. Firefox isn't able to deal with nodelists as input parameter for xstl processing.
. The urlProvider listens now permanently to changes on its input model. Previously it was only executed once. And in case of changes it fires data modification events.
. The simple model has an additional parameter isAutoRefresh, that turns on that a model reloads automatically in case of a changing request model.
. Introduced $bcduiObjectMap shortcut for objects known by BCD-UI. Allows easier listing of all objects and avoids naming conflicts as objects are not longer created as global variables (was an issue in IE)
This is for debugging only and not a replacement of $getObject("myId")

. ClientSettings was not removed in all cases as expected and some widgets did use it wrongly

Incompatibilities:

. Major changes regarding css. All class names start with bcd now and css reset was introduced
. PDF export does support more css settings now. May lead to changed layout due to changes in an external library

. Some widgets tags (for example w:button) will create in-line instead of block elements and change their generated id
. References are now in namespace wrs instead of binding
. Not longer creating a global variable for each object, introduced $bcduiObjectMap shortcut instead, always use $getObject("myId") in your code
. htmlBuilder.xslt was moved into the xslt library
. Instead of the i18n tag, use the init tag to control i18n
. From the column attributes for Wrs and Bindings, the jdbc.column- and jdbc. prefix was removed. For example jdbc.column-type-name became type-name and jdbc.signed became signed
. Data providers are not longer created as global variables, thus write $getObject("myModel").xx instead of myModel.xx
. Parameter rendererId was removed from all widgets Tag- and JS-API. The internal renderer has now always the id = bcdrenderer_&lt;widgetId&gt;

=== Release Notes BCD-UI

BCD-UI 4 brings the following major improvements:

==== Modules and Components

Several core Components and Modules where improved, some where full integrated, having been templates only in previous versions.

Optimized Cube report:: The cube report got significant performance and memory enhancements based on dynamically generated XSLT stylesheets.
Therefore it can handle considerably more data now.
In addition, the cube will allow playing (reordering) with dimensions and measures on the fly without sever requests if the initial request already covered all needed data.
This kind of client-side cube brings high flexibility improved user experience and in addition removes load from the servers.
New enhanced ScoreCard:: The new ScoreCard is now consequently built on top of the repository, eliminating the need for ScoreCard specific configuration
where the information, for example about dimensions and measures, can be derived from the repository.
New Tree Report:: The new tree report allows for easier displaying report data in an hierarchical manner including lazy loading for deep levels.
New enhanced logging system:: The new logging system does now allow to exchange logging messages between client and server.
Further more each logging message can be linked to the corresponding page request, thus allowing to identify the requests belonging
logically together. This eases debugging as well as meaningful performance monitoring.
Caching:: The caching strategies where harmonized and do now allow an easier and more consistent specification of what is to be cached at server and client.
 Cached data can now be stored on file system and in database.

==== New declarative featues

Many features which required custom code in the previous library can now be accessed declarative

Internal XML exchange format for hierarchical data:: For data than can be best represented in hierarchical for two different internal formats are introduced.
One is for data where each level has a consistent typing, as is the case for most reporting data
and one is for heterogeneous data, basically free XML, which is used for configuration information.
XSLT library:: A library of reusable XSLT stylesheets working on Wrs forms the basis of all components in BCD-4 and can also be used for extensions
Repository extension:: The internal repository is extended to support dimensions and measures for the full application setup and not just report internally.
The new repository will span the dimension and measure level across all bindings, thus reducing the need to repeat information on data artifacts and allowing out-of-the-box drill-down and drill-though in much more cases.
Furthermore the new repository is aware of the difference between indicator and plain measures and of root causes as a central artifact.
Combined data access:: A set of central database accessing options is now fully aware of the new repository infrastructure and of measures being stored row-wise to introduce new measures without changing the database schema.
Introduction of themes:: A cleaner separation of styles and functional elements does ease the development in corporate design greatly.
Further more the new themes supports browser-dependent syntax and features of layout

==== Client infrastructure

Browser compatibility for IE&gt;6, FireFox and Chrome:: The library does now fully support all major browsers
I18n:: All components of the library now come with full i18n support. In previous versions, only major components had support build-in.
Better support for integrating 3rd party toolkits:: Rendering and model creation can happen in JavaScript so that external 3rd party toolkits can be more easily integrated.
Fully asynchronous behavior:: All objects on a page are now fully asynchronous and have a declarative dependency.
This allows faster pages and eases development as dependencies do not longer influence the order of declaration.
In addition each component still loading or waiting for a dependency still loading can be displayed as a loading progress bar.
XSLT-embedded choosers:: Choosers yet only available for jsp usage can now also be used XSLT-embedded and this be used in wizards.

==== Development support

Developing with BCD-UI becomes easier in several places due to improvement of the development environment.

Development bootstrapping improvements:: A bootstrap application does now ease starting the development with BCD-UI
Rights model:: The library will support a generic rights concept, which can be address a different places as row-level security or navigation.
Leaving less parts to be built within a project.
Enhanced documentation:: Documentation was rewritten to be more consistent and comprehensive.
It covers general features, as well as code samples and a description of the API.
More consistent API conventions:: Almost any interface was reviewed to allow consistent naming and more speaking conventions for easier use.
Using XML and JavaScript name spaces:: With the introduction of XML schema for all fragments and the new JS core library of BCD-UI, for both elements, namespaces for easier identification are introduced.
Debugging area:: The debugging greatly improves inspection of objects on a page and their behavior
Enhanced internal XML exchange format:: The Wrs format was reviewed and allows a much more comprehensive data exchange now.
A short for is available for manual creation and all elements including choosers are now relying on the Wrs format.
Improved JavaScript support:: All entities that can be created with JSP tags or XSLT have a corresponding JavaScript API call.
